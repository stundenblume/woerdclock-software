BTserialchangeHC06
===================

is a part of w√∂rdclock, a Arduino powered and WS2812B featured Wordclock.

This is a standalone sketch.

You can use it to modify your bluetooth module HC-06 with an Arduino.
No serial monitor is required.

How to connect:
Arduino (5V) with BT (Vcc)
Arduino (Gnc) with BT (Gnc)
Arduino (pin 2) with BT (TX)
Arduino (pin 3) with BT (RX)
Arduino (pin 7) with BT (KEY Pin)

How to use it:
At first, modify the sketch:
1. set the actual baudrate of the bluetooth module, see manual of the module
with mySerial.begin(9600);
2. set the new name with 
mySerial.print("AT+NAMEWC-HC06-BD9600");
where WC-HC06-BD9600 is the new name
3. set the new baudrate with
mySerial.print("AT+BAUD4");
where BAUD4 is for 9600baud
Install the sketch on the Arduino and reboot it.
